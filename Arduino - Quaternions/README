Arduino AHRS for the Core Electronics 10 DOF MEMS Sensor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This AHRS has been tested on the Arduino Nano 3.0 and it should work on any
Arduino that has the memory to support it - including the Arduino Due. 

Not only can it run on the Arduino Due but it can easily be changed to 
operate using the second I2C bus on the Due. Just change line 8 in I2CDevice.h
to this

#define I2C_BUS Wire1



This AHRS algorithm is based on the works of Sebastian Madgwick. 
http://www.x-io.co.uk/open-source-imu-and-ahrs-algorithms/

According to his report, this algorithm can perform 'as well as a high 
quality commercial Kalman-based system'. It's basically the greatest thing for
hobbyists who require AHRS information for their projects. 

I have pretty much just copy-pasted Madwicks algorithm and wrapped it up with 
my imu maths library. 

The sensors in use come on the 10 DOF MEMs Sensor from Core Electronics. 
This little board is one of the highest quality mems breakout boards that I 
have tried. It's a seriously good board if you need accurate, low noise 
measurements.

It's available here.
